        In the late 1990s, Microsoft began developing a managed code runtime and programming language (C#) which it
        billed together as part of the ".NET platform", with the core runtime and software libraries comprising the .NET
        Framework.
        At the heart of the .NET Platform is the .NET Framework, a high-productivity, multilanguage development and
        execution environment for building and running Web services with important features such as cross-language
        inheritance and debugging.
        Soon after the announcement of the C# language at the Professional Developers Conference in 2000 and previews of
        its software became available, Microsoft began a standardization effort through ECMA for what it dubbed the
        Common Language Infrastructure.
        The company continued development and support of its own implementation as proprietary, closed source software
        in the meantime.
