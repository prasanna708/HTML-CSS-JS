    <h1>ChatGPT</h1>
    <p>
        ChatGPT is a chatbot and virtual assistant developed by OpenAI and launched on November 30, 2022. Based on large
        language models (LLMs), it enables users to refine and steer a conversation towards a desired length, format,
        style, level of detail, and language. Successive user prompts and replies are considered at each conversation
        stage as context.</p>
    <p style="background-color:yellow; opacity:0.6;">
        ChatGPT is credited with starting the AI boom, which has led to ongoing rapid investment in and public attention
        to the field of artificial intelligence. By January 2023, it had become what was then the fastest-growing
        consumer software application in history, gaining over 100 million users and contributing to the growth of
        OpenAI's current valuation of $86 billion. ChatGPT's release spurred the release of competing products,
        including Gemini, Claude, Llama, Ernie, and Grok. Microsoft launched Copilot, based on OpenAI's GPT-4. In June
        2024, a partnership between Apple Inc. and OpenAI was announced in which ChatGPT is integrated into the Apple
        Intelligence feature of Apple operating systems. Some observers raised concern about the potential of ChatGPT
        and similar programs to displace or atrophy human intelligence, enable plagiarism, or fuel misinformation.

    <p>ChatGPT is built on OpenAI's proprietary series of generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) models and is
        fine-tuned for conversational applications using a combination of supervised learning and reinforcement learning
        from human feedback. ChatGPT was released as a freely available research preview, but due to its popularity,
        OpenAI now operates the service on a freemium model. Users on its free tier can access GPT-4o and GPT-3.5. The
        ChatGPT subscriptions "Plus", "Team" and "Enterprise" provide additional features such as DALL-E 3 image
        generation and increased GPT-4o usage limit.

    <h3>Training</h3>
    <p>ChatGPT is based on particular GPT foundation models, namely GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and GPT-4o, that were fine-tuned to
        target conversational usage.[11] The fine-tuning process leveraged supervised learning and reinforcement
        learning from human feedback (RLHF). Both approaches employed human trainers to improve model performance. In
        the case of supervised learning, the trainers played both sides: the user and the AI assistant. In the
        reinforcement learning stage, human trainers first ranked responses that the model had created in a previous
        conversation. These rankings were used to create "reward models" that were used to fine-tune the model further
        by using several iterations of proximal policy optimization.

        Time magazine revealed that to build a safety system against harmful content (e.g., sexual abuse, violence,
        racism, sexism), OpenAI used outsourced Kenyan workers earning less than $2 per hour to label harmful content.
        These labels were used to train a model to detect such content in the future. The outsourced laborers were
        exposed to "toxic" and traumatic content; one worker described the assignment as "torture". OpenAI's outsourcing
        partner was Sama, a training-data company based in San Francisco, California.
